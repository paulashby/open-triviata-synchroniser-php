# open-triviata-synchroniser-php
PHP port of the scraper orginally written in Python.</br>
Associate Open Trivia questions with ID numbers and store in a new database.</br>
The ultimate plan is to expose a similar API that allows question IDs to be used to efficiently store and retrieve custom quizzes.</br>
I mean to use this in my final project for CS50 which is a quiz app.</br>
